            How to care for your new roof once it's installed?
        </h2>
        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>
            One of the most important things to remember after your new roof is installed is to take care of it! Make sure you keep any trees or other objects from hitting your roof and make sure that you don’t go on the roof yourself. It’s also a good idea to keep an eye on your roof for any potential problems and to have it inspected regularly.
